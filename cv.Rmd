## Research & technical skills
* I have extensive experience with all stages of the data analysis and modelling workflow, including: data cleaning and visualization; model building, fitting, selection, and posterior inference; and using simulations for model validation, parameter recovery, and model exploration. I am currently developing a joint neuro-cognitive modelling pipeline for simulating and fitting cognitive and neurophysiological models to multiple data sources (e.g., EEG + fMRI + behaviour) simultaneously within a fully Bayesian framework. I also have extensive experience analyzing data using conventional and hierarchical Bayesian statistical models (GLM/GLMMs).
* I have extensive experience with the R programming language. I use Git for version control and GitHub as an open record of my modelling and analysis code. I have experience using research computing servers to model large datasets in parallel. 
* I have extensive experience writing scientific research reports for publication in high-impact journals, and an aptitude for public speaking, as demonstrated by my many conference talks and substantial teaching experience. 
* I have extensive experience designing and running scientific experiments and collecting data.
* I have also developed management skills in my role as a post-doc at the University of Amsterdam, in which I have coordinated teams from The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Australia to produce high-quality research and scientific publications. I also organized several conferences and modelling workshops, and have experience coordinating lab meeting guest speakers.
